<h1>My Childhood Memories</h1>

<h2>Early Years</h2>
<p>In 2010, when I was around six years old, my little sister was born my mother is in the hospital. In the absence of my mother, my father took care of me and my brother. My brother and I have to stay at home together because my father has to go to work and he returns in the evening. The story begin where my brother offered himself to cut my hair like a famous artist's hairstyle. Listening to that, I was excited and trusted him to cut my hair. How stupid I was then. As she cut my hair, I couldn't wait to see the results. And... my head is almost bald.</p></p>

<h2>School Days</h2>
<p>The memory of my first day at school is me drawing on the test paper and not knowing if it was a test or a drawing class. The test is to determine the class of first grade students who have just entered school. And the result is that I entered the fifth class out of six classes. Everything that happens has a meaning, it was in that class that I met my best friend.</p>
<p>Throughout the school year, my favorite subject is english. I liked the subject because I heard a melodious English song on the school bus radio and wanted to know the meaning of the song in Malay. Besides, English can be used in most countries, so I want to learn and speak English fluently.</p>

<h2>Holidays and Playtime</h2>
<p><b>Games I Played</b></p>
<p>As a child, I immersed myself in a variety of games that fueled my imagination and honed my skills. Outdoor adventures often included classic games like hide-and-seek, where we transformed our neighborhood into a vast playground. On rainy days, board games like Monopoly and Scrabble were our go-to choices, creating friendly rivalries and laughter-filled evenings. Video games also played a significant role, with titles like Super Mario </p>
<p><b>Holidays Celebrated</b></p>
<p>Holidays were always a special time, filled with joy, family, and traditions. Hari Raya Aidilfitri was perhaps the most magical, with the excitement of decorating the house, making kuih raya and others food, and the warmth of family gatherings. </p>
